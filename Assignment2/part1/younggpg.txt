# PGP4Win

All of the screen shot are labeled and can be found in the assets directory.

## Task 1: Use GPG4Win to set up OpenPGP certificates for 2 users A and B in your group.

    In step-by-step guide, cwagne17@students.towson.edu will be associated with User A, and christopherwagner0700@gmail.com will be associated with User B.

### Open Kleopatra to create a new PGP key pair & Certificate

    On UserA's machine, open Kleopatra to create a key pair.

    Kleopatra Home Screen: refer to assets/01_Kelopatra_Home_Screen.png

    Enter a name and email address to associate to the certificate. Optionally add a passphrase.

    Create Key Pair: refer to assets/02_Create_Key_Pair.png

    If adding a passphrase enter a phrase. The example uses 'test123'.

    Add Key Pair Passphrase: refer to assets/03_Add_Passphrase.png  

    Note that 'test123' is not a strong password and Kleopatra will suggest making a stronger password before continuing.

### Exchange the public OpenPGP certificates of A and B using email.

    Export the certificate from Kleopatra at the top of the dashboard and choose the file path to export the certificate to.

    Export Certificate from Kleopatra: refer to assets/05_Export_Certificate.png

    In an email attach te exported certificate to send to User B.

### User A uses GPG4Win to sign and encrypt a small file test.txt.

    In this example a test.txt file was created with a transcript of the Gettysburg address. The content of the file is not critical to what is being accomplished in this task.

    Create Test Text File: refer to assets/07_Create_Test_Text_File.png

    User A then encrypts the content of test.txt by highlighting their Certificate, clicking Sign/Encrypt at the top of the screen, then choosing the file path to encrypt.

    Sign and Encrypt Test File: refer to assets/08_Sign_Encrypt_Test_File.png

    A window appears after choosing the file that gives more options when signing/encrypting. The default values are sufficient. Options are available however to include names, email addresses, and passwords when encrypting.

    Sign and Encrypt Test File: refer to assets/09_Sign_Encrypt_Test_File.png

    Because a passphrase was set on the key pair, use the same passphrase to open the key pair to encrypt the test.txt file with.

    The file will then be encrypted and placed in your file system as test.txt.gpg.

    At this point transfer the encrypted file to UserB for them to decrypt.

### B uses GPG4Win to decrypt and verify the results.

    After User B downloads both the Certificate and Encrypted file attached in emails, User A's certificate can be imported to Kleopatra.

    User B Imports User A Certificate: refer to assets/10_UserB_Imports_UserA_Certificate.png

    User A's certificate will need to be verified and a way to do this is to verify that the cert is from User A is by having User B confirm it is.

    For this to happen, User B must create a certificate.

    Create User B Key for Verification: refer to assets/11_Create_UserB_Key_For_Verification.png

    Once a certificate is create, User B can verify that User A has a valid certificate. This would be done by contacting User A to authenticate. This is the basis of how peer-to-peer certifactes can have trust. X.509 on the other hand would have a trust anchor of some sort to verify them.

    Certify User A With User B Cert: refer to assets/12_Certify_UserA_With_UserB_Cert.png

    User B can use User A's verified certificate to Decrypt the encrypted test.txt.gpg file.

    Decrypt Test File with Imported Certificate: refer to assets/13_Decrypt_Test_File.png

    A successful message or error message will occur depending if Kleopatra was able to decrypt with User A's certificate.

    In this case, we are able to successfully decrypt User A's encrypted message and retrieve the Getty's Burg Address.
